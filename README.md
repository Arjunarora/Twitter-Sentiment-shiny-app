# Twitter-Sentiment-shiny-app

This is my first shiny application made on RShiny in Rstudio.
It is based on the previous repositary sentiment_analysis. That just contains the methods to collect tweets and apply sentiments. While, this app is a better user interface of the previous work with additional facilities. This application does all that without ever looking at the code. Also it provides better plots and a time period for analysis.
